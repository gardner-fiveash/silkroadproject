Solo project: Gardner Fiveash

Project description: My project has two parts: 1. Investigating how Silk Road was technically implemented and 2. How the FBI was able to take it down. 

For part 1, I will be expanding on what we talked about in class with regards to BitTorrent and anonymous networks. I will also look at the role of bitcion in silk road, why it was chosen, was it really the best choice for currency, etc. 

For part 2, I plan to get a lot of my info from specific court documents that came to light following the case against Ross Ulbricht. I'm starting my investiagation by re-reading the Wired magazine article detaling how the FBI caught Ulbricht. 

My project has totally changed since last week. I was originally going to do a BlockCypher project for a friend of Josh Cincinnatti but have decided to go this direction instead. I'm way more interested in this topic and the technical components of the other were over my head. 

I'm expecting the general progression of this project to be read the below articles and watch the documentary to get a sense of which topics I need to learn the most about in order to explain how Silk Road was technically implemented. Continue to research and read technical papers until I understand Silk Road enough to explain to the class. Look at how the FBI took it down and talk about some of the other strategies they could have chosen. Conclusion will be going forward why (or why not) a similar service to Silk Road could be implemented. 

Right now I'm still in phase 1, reading and watching the below links.
